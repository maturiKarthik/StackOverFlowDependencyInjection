# StackOverFlowDI [ðŸ’‰]



The objective  of this application was to implement the dependecy injection in the MVVM architecture pattern avoiding manual dependency injection to reduce the boiler plate code.



I have choosed to use Hilt rather than Koin since the Hilt is developed by google and it is a part of android jetpack library and well documentation by google which inisted me to use Hilt. The below link provides the clean documentation for hilt written by google [https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection].
